# Convener's/Volunteer's Assignment
This is an assignment for the application of convener or a volunteer in [Cybersecurity Club IITB](https://www.facebook.com/groups/csec.iitb).  
There are 4 tasks, try to complete the tasks. You dont need to complete all the tasks, just do as much as you can (even writeups of tasks which have not been solved but show your directionality of thinking are appreciated). But remember, you need to make a detailed writeup on the tasks even if you were not able to complete the task. We dont seek answers, we seek methods full of creativity and a fearless desire to learn more.

## How to submit?
Just make a **private** github repository for the writeups and code for solutions and add @zehrileLaunde as a contributor (zehrileLaunde@protonmail.com)

In the README.md file, also mention your
1. Email id
2. Name
3. Departement/Year
4. **Enthu**

## Deadline
The deadline for the assignment is 6th July 2020 23:59 IST
Selected candidates would be contacted by us on the provided email ids and would be interviewed on 7th July onwards

## Task 1
You are provided with the file output.txt which has been split into 4 parts [part1](task1/part1), [part2](task1/part2), [part3](task1/part3) and [part4](task1/part4) . The file contains all possible combination of 3 bytes (all possible 3 byte strings) except some few. All you need to find out is which combinations are not present.

All the 3-byte combinations are spearated by a newline ('\n').  
> It would be fun if you can form an english sentence out of them  
> Brownie points for code to generate such a file

## Task 2
Not intimated with the beauty of screens? Well, you shall be now given that I generated some funky equations for you to solve in [task2/output.txt](task2/output.txt).  
Simply solve them (only after figuring out how to read them :stuck_out_tongue:)  
Also, only integers are involved so division is integer division.
Give me the answers once you are done :wink:

## Task 3
Write a script in the language of your choice to get admin's password. Even if you are not able to solve this challenge, write your ideas about how it can be done or which vulnerability can be exploited in the challenge. Here's the IP [52.183.128.218](http://52.183.128.218)

## Task 4
We have intercepted the handshake between an android device and a wifi router named "Friday". Crack the password of this router. The password is present in the custom wordlist provided and it will not take you more than 5 seconds to crack it.

Dont get stressed out! It is supposed to be a fun activity!
For passing distress signals, ping deuterium#1689 (for tasks 1 and 2 or any general query) or p0i5on#5594 (for tasks 3 or 4) on discord.
